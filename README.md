# CI/CD Pipeline for Application using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Webhooks

This project demonstrates a full CI/CD setup:
- Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy a Node.js app
- Docker image build and push to DockerHub
- Deploy application on Minikube (local Kubernetes)
- Trigger pipeline automatically using GitHub webhook via ngrok

## ðŸš€ Jenkinsfile Explanation

The `Jenkinsfile` defines the following stages:

1. **Checkout**
   - Clone the GitHub repository.

2. **Unit Test**
   - Automatically detects project type:
     - If `pom.xml` âž” runs `mvn test`
     - If `package.json` âž” runs `npm install` and `npm test`
     - If `requirements.txt` âž” runs `pip install` and `pytest`
   - If no recognizable structure, prints a message.

3. **Build Docker Image and Push**
   - Build a Docker image from the codebase.
   - Authenticate with DockerHub using credentials stored in Jenkins.
   - Push the image to your DockerHub repository.

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
   - Use kubeconfig credentials to authenticate.
   - Deploy Kubernetes manifests (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`).
   - Wait until deployment rollout is successful.

5. **Post Actions**
   - If build succeeds or fails, clean workspace.
   - Send email notifications with build details.

## ðŸŒŽ Environment Variables (in Jenkins Pipeline)

Inside the `Jenkinsfile`, environment variables are defined like this:

```groovy
environment {
    DOCKER_IMAGE = 'yourdockerhubusername/yourappname:tag'
    KUBECONFIG_CREDENTIALS_ID = 'jenkins-credential-id-for-kubeconfig'
    DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID = 'jenkins-credential-id-for-dockerhub'
}
```
## Jenkins Credentials Setup

To use DockerHub and Kubernetes credentials in your Jenkins Pipeline:

Go to:  
**Manage Jenkins â†’ Manage Credentials â†’ (Global) â†’ Add Credentials**

Create the following:

- **DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID**
  - Kind: Username with password
  - Username: Your DockerHub username
  - Password: Your DockerHub password
  - ID: `jenkins-credential-id-for-dockerhub`

- **KUBECONFIG_CREDENTIALS_ID**
  - Kind: Secret file
  - Upload your `kubeconfig` file (`~/.kube/config`)
  - ID: `jenkins-credential-id-for-kubeconfig`

# Webhook Setup - Why Localhost Doesn't Work

GitHub Webhooks cannot send requests to localhost because:

- localhost is private to your machine.
- GitHub servers cannot reach your local computer directly.

## Solution:

We need a public URL to receive webhook requests.
for that I uses **ngrok** Which uses reverse proxy for localhost

# For Monitoring of Jenkins Jobs, I use Prometheus and Grafana
